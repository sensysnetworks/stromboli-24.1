****** PREEMPT EXAMPLE ******

This is a simple test to verify that a fast high priority task preempts a long
lasting lower priority one.
By setting the macro SCHED_LOCK in rt_process.c you can also check the use of 
the functions rt_sched_lock()/rt_sched_unlock in blocking the preemption of a 
lower priority task.

To use it type:

make clean
make
./run

Alternatively use your own insmod/rmmod after make.
