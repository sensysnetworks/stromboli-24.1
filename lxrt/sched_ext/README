This module links modules that are needed for QNX compatibility, named objects 
creation and release of resources in the "informed" way. It should be used as 
a scheduler extension for kernel space only applications, i.e. those not using 
LXRT. In the case LXRT is already in use everything will be in LXRT already.

The example does the same thing as the IPC example without LXRT at all as the
client and server run in the kernel.
