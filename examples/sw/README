****** SW EXAMPLE ******

This example features NTASKS realtime tasks running periodically.
On each period one of them sets a bit on the parallel port, another one
resets it. By choosing an appropriate timings one can produce a rectangular
wave on the parallel port which can be watched on an oscilloscope plugged
into it.

->>>> Be carefull about the macro TICK_PERIOD its value is now set
      for a 200Mhz PPro, which can be to much for a less powerfull machine.

To run the example type:

make clean
make
./run

To stop it type :

./rem
