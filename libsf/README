Soft Float Library
==================

(C) 2002 Thomas Gleixner (gleixner@autronix.de)

To avoid using the kernel floatingpoint emulator via undefined 
opcode exceptions, you can use the softfloat library module.

Version	1.0
-----------

Attention: You need gcc/glibc compiled with softfloat support !

Current implementation for ARMV only. To support other arch-
itectures, a architecture specific directory has to be defined.
The name of this directory has to be the same as the ARCH define, 
which we get from the kernel defines. See: TOPDIR/.buildvars 

Contents of TOPDIR/libsf/$ARCH:

- fplib_glue.S	arch specific function wrappers, if needed
		
- subdirectory PROCESSOR

The name of this directory has to be the same as the PROCESSOR
define, which we get from the kernel defines. See: TOPDIR/.buildvars 		
If the contents are the same for different processors, you can use 
a link to a existing directory

Contents of TOPDIR/libsf/$ARCH/PROCESSOR:

- Makefile 	processor specific flags and include paths

- arch.h	processor specific include file, which 
		contains defines for the libgcc hack
		(see libgcc for further information)

If your arch/processor needs more exports from libgcc than actually 
implemented, modify TOPDIR/libsf/sf_exports.h and define these 
in your specific arch.h file.
