****** ROUND ROBIN (RR) SCHEDULING EXAMPLE ******

This example demonstrates RR scheduling. It features NTASKS realtime tasks each

they all can work alternatively because of the RR policy.
Various macros in rt_process allows to experiment the use of different 
parameters values.

To run the example type:

make clean
make
./run

To remove it type:

./rem
