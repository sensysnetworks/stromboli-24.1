	* rt_com.c (rt_com_isr): bug-fix submitted by Giuseppe Renoldi: 
	I'm using rt_com 0.5.3 with RTAI, and analyzing the code I think to
 	have found a bug and a "not optimal behaviour". The bug is that at the
 	end of the interrupt routine there is a wrong check to see if there are
 	other interrupts pending.  In fact the original code checks if the low
 	nibble of IIR is zero, but when there are no interrupts pending, the
 	low nibble of IIR is 0x01 and not zero!!!. And if there are no
 	interrupt, the default is to execute the "disable Transmitter Holding
 	Register Empty Interrupt" and you can see that it can be executed 4
 	times (4 useless and expensive IOs).
	The "not optimal behaviour" is that the rt_com use implicitly only 4
 	characters of the TX FIFO. So you have a TX interrupt every 4
 	characters instead of 16. I think that the "magical" number 4 that
 	initialize the loop variable is related to the "4 characters time" of
 	the RX timeout (or the 4 possible interrupt sources ??) but anyway I
 	think that it is not correct to do so.  The right way should be to put
 	characters in the FIFO only when you are sure that it's empty so you
 	can put in 16 characters.


2000-05-05  Jochen Küpper  <Jochen@Jochen-Kuepper.de>

	* release 0.5.3

	* README: Updated ml info, removed note regarding setserial, it wasn´t
	correct any more and should be in the docs.

	* rt_com.c (rt_com_setup): Assure correct parity flags by bitwise and
 	with the parity bitmask ( 0x38 ) instead of the wrong if-clause.

2000-05-03  Jochen Küpper  <Jochen@Jochen-Kuepper.de>

	* rt_com.c (rt_com_set_param): If port is negative, deinitialize
 	hardware setup. If used-meber is changed, request or release the memory
 	region and the IRQ line accordingly.

2000-04-12  Jochen Küpper  <Jochen@Jochen-Kuepper.de>

	* release: 0.5.2

	* rt_com.h (RT_COM_BUF_SIZ): Typo - set to 0x0100 !

2000-03-10  Jochen Küpper  <Jochen@Jochen-Kuepper.de>

	* release: 0.5.1

	* Makefile (rt_com.tar.gz): 

	* PROBLEMS: Add this file.

	* rt_com.c, rt_com.h, rt_comP.h: Cleanup.

	* Makefile: Modified to match the packaging changes: Different
	documentation, licensing files. Preserve relative paths when creating
	distribution. 

1999-11-16  Jochen Küpper  <jochen@uni-duesseldorf.de>

	* rt_com.c (rt_com_enable_fifo): Put "namespace prefix" to enable_fifo.

1999-11-11  Jochen Küpper  <jochen@uni-duesseldorf.de>

	* rt_com.c, rt_com.h, rt_comP.h:
 	Put in modifications by Roberto	Finazzi <finaz@tin.it>:
	- Setting port and irq addresses for a com from user space. In this
	  case the port region request isn't performed by init_module but at
	  the end of this function.
	- You can set many functioning mode of the hand shake signals. It is
	  possible to make a communication without any hand shake signals
 	  ( only RXD, TXD and GND connected ) or you can also have an
	  automatic hardware flow control by RTS-CTS signals. 
	- It is possible to clear input and output buffer
 	  ( the characters stored in the fifos also ).
	- You can read the remaining free space in the output buffer.
	- You can read or write all the hand-shake signals 
	  ( DTR, RTS, CTS, DSR, RI and DCD ).
	- You can have the last error detected by UART ( Receive data overrun,
	  Parity error, Framing error, Break detected) and by software ( input
 	  buffer full ).

	Do not define MODULE, __KERNEL__, __RT__ twice.

1999-10-01  Jochen Küpper  <jochen@uni-duesseldorf.de>

	* rt_com.c: Make this module RTAI aware. It should work for NMT
	RT-Linux v1 and v2 and for RTAI ( v0.6 ).

	* rt_com.c: Determine the number of rt_com_table entries automatically.
	(rt_com_read), (rt_com_write), (rt_com_irq_get), (rt_com_irq_put):
 	Wrap FIFO head/tail by explicit check for the maximum element instead
 	of the tricky binary and. So we can use any size now.
	(init_module): On failure really free all allocated resources, not just
	the last one several times.
