8254 Calibration
================

The module rt_cal, allows to check the time it takes to write two bytes to
the 8254 timer. Such a time is required for the oneshot timer and sets the
macro SETUP_TIME_8254 in rtai.h. It is a very simple module that just
calls an undocumented entry in rtai.c.

To use it do:

  make
  make clean
  make cal

When the calibrated value is on the screen do: 

  make stop
