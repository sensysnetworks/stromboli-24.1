RT_COM_LXRT
===========

This contribution, from Giuseppe Renoldi (giuseppe@renoldi.org),
strengthens the RTAI approach to symmetric usage of all services in
kernel-user space for soft-hard real time. 

Giuseppe contributed also the few changes to lxrt.c and rtai_lxrt.h needed
to support it. His original changes have been further modified by Pierre in
RTAI for Linux 2.4.xx to allow a safer addition of users extensions, see
also the leds module for another examples extending LXRT functionalities.
In fact here you'll find the RTAI user space interface to the rt_com
package to be used when serial ports are required in hard-soft real time
user space applications. 

There are also the same tests you can find in rt_com package. These tests
can be of help in learning how to use it. It requires you to have the
original rt_com package installed. The rt_com package found in this
distribution is ready to be interfaced to your user space applications
simply by including rt_com_lxrt.h in the code files using it. 

To use it you must insmod rtai, rtai_sched, rt_com, lxrt, and any other
RTAI module you need. 

Note that before running the examples found here it is likely you have to
change the macro RT_COM_DIR and LINUX_DIR in the Makefile, according to
your installation of rt_com and Linux include directory.

To use the all stuff do: make clean, make, from this directory.

Send any comment/feedback to Giuseppe.
