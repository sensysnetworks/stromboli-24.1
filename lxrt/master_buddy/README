The running of this test is self contained. Nonetheless you need to have 
compiled and installed: rtai.c and a scheduler appropriate to your PC.
To have them all available just follow the usual RTAI installation procedure, 
do "make all" and then install the needed scheduler.
Note that "make clean"s are repeated just to make it safe, please do them at 
least once after installing. There is the possibility of doing it all at once
from within directory "newlxrt" by: "making cleanall", just to be sure, followed
by "make all".

This test runs through most of the available RTAI services using two Linux 
communicating processes.

To run it:
make clean
make
./run
