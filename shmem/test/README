This directory contains a test to show the use of shared memory.
It is a self contained, except for kvmem.h, directory that duplicates the 
production version with debugging print added.

For testing, staying in this directory:
- make
- insmod rtai_shm
- ./start  (or "insmod kalloc" followed by "./itest &")
- ./ctest
- ./ctest
- ./ctest ..... you can continue with ctest
- ./stop   (or "./ftest" followed by "rmmod kalloc")
- rmmod rtai_shm
- make clean
By following what appears on the screen there should be a confirmation that it
works (or does not?)!

The above sequence is for a correct use but it contains already duplicated and
not paired malloc/free call for testing reasons. You can try also what happens 
by scrambling the sequence. The idea is that you should not be able to rmmod 
rtai_shm till the areas are engaged.
