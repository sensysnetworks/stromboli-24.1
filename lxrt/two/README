The running of this test is self contained. Nonetheless you need to have 
compiled and installed: rtai.c and a scheduler appropriate to your PC.
To have them all available just follow the usual RTAI installation procedure, 
do "make all" and then install the needed scheduler.
Note that "make clean"s are repeated just to make it safe, please do them at 
least once after installing. There is the possibility of doing it all at once
from within directory "newlxrt" by: "making cleanall", just to be sure, followed
by "make all".

This test verifies common operations of two tasks, one running in hard real
time mode the other in soft mode.
Under front end activity you see immediatly the difference in latencies printed
on the screen at the end: task 1000 runs in hard mode, 2000 in soft mode.

You can control period and duration through macros in test.h.

To run it:
make clean
make
./run
