Finding the Right GCC for Compiling RTAI and the Kernel
=======================================================

Currently the recommended compiler for RTAI and the Linux kernel is

                          gcc-2.95.3 

It is possible that gcc-3.x.x works for the kernel, in fact later tests 
compiling Linux 2.4.xx with gcc-3.2 do seem to produce a working kernel, 
despite some warning floods. So RTAI now works with gcc-3.2, at least as 
well as Linux does.
Nonetheless gcc-3.x.x is not yet the official accepted compiler for Linux, 
so if you use anything else besides 2.95.3 you are partly on your own.

Nevertheless, you are welcome to send patches/infos to the RTAI mailing list
which help in improving compiling RTAI with non-supported compilers.
