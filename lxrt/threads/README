The running of this test is self contained. Nonetheless you need to have 
compiled and installed: rtai.c and a scheduler appropriate to your PC.
To have them all available just follow the usual RTAI installation procedure, 
do "make all" and then install the needed scheduler.
Note that "make clean"s are repeated just to make it safe, please do them at 
least once after installing. There is the possibility of doing it all at once
from within directory "newlxrt" by: "making cleanall", just to be sure, followed
by "make all".

This test verifies common operations in soft and hard real time modes of many
tasks launched through pthrad_create; number of tasks, timing and durations
controlled by macros in rt_process.h.
The possibility of using pthread_create to generate Linux processes is very
usefull since it allows a task layout that is close to the structure of modules.
That could make it easier the translation to kernel modules for maximum
performances.
Under computer load check jitters printed at the end, even tasks run in hard 
mode, odd ones in soft mode.

To run it:
make clean
make
./run
