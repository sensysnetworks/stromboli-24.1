****** SWITCHES EXAMPLES ******

This directory checks task switching time for hard real time processes (user
space) environment, by repeated use of suspend/resumes and sem_wait/sem_signal.
There are two implementations that do the same basic thing, but use different
ways to setup and close the application. See the code in rt_process1 and 
rt_process2

To use it type:
make clean
make
followed by
./run1
or
./run2
then follow the instructions.
