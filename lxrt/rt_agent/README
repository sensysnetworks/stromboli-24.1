The running of this test is self contained. Nonetheless you need to have 
compiled and installed: rtai.c and a scheduler appropriate to your PC.
To have them all available just follow the usual RTAI installation procedure, 
do "make all" and then install the needed scheduler.
Note that "make clean"s are repeated just to make it safe, please do them at 
least once after installing. There is the possibility of doing it all at once
from within directory "newlxrt" by: "making cleanall", just to be sure, followed
by "make all".

This test uses a periodic agent real time task that, after having done its
work, actually nothing, relay data sent to him through shared memory by a
sender Linux process to a receiver Linux processes. The sender is synchronized 
to the agent real time task by using semaphores, while the receiver uses 
intertask messages. There are two macros to be cared of: TICK_PERIOD in agent.c,
to determine the ticking, COUNT in sender.c, to define the number of times to 
repeat the test. It should be matched to TICK_PERIOD as the product of the too 
is roughly the time spent to run the test.

To run it:
make clean
make
./run
