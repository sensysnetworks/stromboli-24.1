RTAI Testsuite
--------------

The testsuite uses 'sudo' to run commands like 'insmod', 'modprobe' etc. An
easy (but unsecure!) way to allow this is adding something like

	username  ALL= NOPASSWD: ALL

to /etc/sudoers, which lets you execute all commands as root, without
asking for a password.   

Please note that this is highly insecure, as you are allowed to execute
every command with root permissions! Don't use this on production machines
or on systems which are used for 'normal' work. You have been warned!

We probably need a more universal way to load non-installed modules.
Something like rt_modprobe, but without perl :^)
