This module and library extends LXRT (the original concept is from Giuseppe 
Renoldi (giuseppe@renoldi.org), see ../rt_com_lxrt) to implement my brute force
and total ignorance trace tool kit:

. The kernel and rtai source trees are no longer clubbered by *_leds() functions
  nobody else wants...

. It shows how to extend LXRT with a simple example.

. Files ../traps/runh and ../traps/test_hrt.c show how to use it.

Have fun,

Pierre
