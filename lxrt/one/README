This test verifies the basic idea of hard real time in user space. It can be 
run either in soft or hard real time mode; if you have some disk activity you 
can immediately verify the differences in latency between the two modes of 
execution, just look at what is printed on the screen at the end of the run.
There is also a simple use of an LXRT specific signal function for hard real
time processes in user space.

You can control period and duration through macros in test.h.

To run it:
make clean
make
./run
