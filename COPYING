Copying
=======

The intent of RTAI developers is to make the code that we write to be
widely useful and that it can be copied and incorporated into other works,
including libraries.  In addition, we wish to make it explicitly clear that
linking proprietary code with RTAI is an acceptible use -- for these
reasons, we have chosen the LGPL as the distribution license.

However, at the current time, RTAI contains portions that are derived from
GPL code, so if you are in a situation where the difference between GPL and
LGPL is an issue, please ask.

Some people are concerned with distributing proprietary kernel modules for
Linux based on RTAI. From the RTAI standpoint, this is clearly allowed,
because RTAI is LGPL (aside from the previous paragraph). The Linux kernel
situation is less clear, but the common practice for many years has been
that proprietary kernel modules are allowed as long as they only use
published interfaces to the kernel, examples being OSS sound drivers, AFS,
and Vmware.

Moreover, proprietary user-space applications using LXRT are unabiguously
allowed, since LXRT is 100% LGPL and creates a user/kernel boundary.

Copies of the GPL and LGPL can be found in the Documentation/ directory.
