How to install COMEDI_LXRT
==========================

IMPORTANT!!!
In the Makefiles, it is assumed that the COMEDI stuff is under /usr/src/comedi.
If not so, change the related path into Makefile and lib/Makefile,
according to your setup.

From RTAI directory:
- make menuconfig (selecting COMEDI support in user space)
- make dep

From COMEDI directory:
- make (selecting Real-time support and Kernel comedilib)
- make

From RTAI directory:
- make
- make install
- make dev

From COMEDI directory:
- make install
- make dev

All stuff here is based on "comedi-0.7.65", no hope for any backward
compatibility with previous COMEDI releases.

Have fun!
