The running of this test is self contained. Nonetheless you need to have 
compiled and installed: rtai.c and a scheduler appropriate to your PC.
To have them all available just follow the usual RTAI installation procedure, 
do "make all" and then install the needed scheduler.
Note that "make clean"s are repeated just to make it safe, please do them at 
least once after installing. There is the possibility of doing it all at once
from within directory "newlxrt" by: "making cleanall", just to be sure, followed
by "make all".

This test shows two ways for waking up user space hard real time processes
directly from interrupt handlers. The process itself can then act, partly or 
as a whole, as an interrupt handler. Do not confuse it with bottom halves,
it is better, more direct, effective and true real time. It is based on using 
either suspend/resume or semaphore wait/signal.

You can control period, duration and wakeup method through macros in period.h.

To run it do:
make clean
make
./run
