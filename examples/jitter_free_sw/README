****** JITTER_FREE_SW EXAMPLE ******

This example features NTASKS realtime tasks
running periodically in oneshot mode.
On each period one of them sets a bit on the parallel port, another one
resets it. By choosing an appropriate timings one can produce
a rectangular wave on the parallel port which can be watched
on an oscilloscope plugged into it.

With respect to the "sw" test they are different in that they implement a 
schedule ahead concept and wait, with interrupt disabled insured by the signal
function, for the right time to execute. So the associated wave fronts are 
almost jitter free and on a scope you should see steady square fronts.
(Suggested to me by Tomasz Motylesky, usage of the same idea in MARUTI, a hard 
real time FERRARI, pointed out by Manoj Apte).

->>>> Be carefull about the macros MAX_JITTER, TICK_PERIOD
      and NTASKS; they must suite your PC.

To run the example type:

make clean
make
./run

to stop it type:

./rem

Alternatively use your own insmod/rmmod after make.
