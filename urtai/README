			<*> RTAI-based bootdisk <*>

What found in this directory makes it possible to build a bootdisk with RTAI 
installed, "urtai", that means micro-RTAI.

To use it just type "sh mkurtai.sh", from within this directory and let it work,
just answer to what appears on the screen. It should be self-contained, it gets 
everything you'll need automatically from the net:
- linux kernel, from ftp.funet.fi (comfortable from DIAPM);
- rtai, from www.aero.polimi.it;
- busybox, from ftp.uclibc.org;
- uClibc, from ftp.uclibc.org.
Notice that all of what is needed goes here and so this directory will end up
"somewhat" inflated. Do not be astonished to find it occupying a couple of
hundreds megabytes more. 

To use it you've to:
- have syslinux installed on your host;
- have a kernel configured with:
	- loopback device support (block devices);
	- ramdisk support (block devices);
	- initial RAMDISK support.

It is somewhat static, but it works as needed here at DIAPM. Naturally it can 
be made even more flexible and better parameterized.

Have fun, help fixing bugs and improve it.
