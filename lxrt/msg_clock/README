The running of this test is self contained. Nonetheless you need to have 
compiled and installed: rtai.c and a scheduler appropriate to your PC.
To have them all available just follow the usual RTAI installation procedure, 
do "make all" and then install the needed scheduler.
Note that "make clean"s are repeated just to make it safe, please do them at 
least once after installing. There is the possibility of doing it all at once
from within directory "newlxrt" by: "making cleanall", just to be sure, followed
by "make all".

This test implements a digital clock with messages, it mimics the one already
used in RTAI examples (from an idea found in: Andre' Schiper, Programmation 
Concurrent, Presses Polytechnique et Universitaires Romandes, Geneve).
It is a fairly complex set of cooperating tasks generated by using pthread 
create.

To run it:
make clean
make
./run
./keybrd
(Then type command shown in the command frame to make it work, f-enter to end.)
./del
