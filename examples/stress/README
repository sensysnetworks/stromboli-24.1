****** STRESS EXAMPLE ******

What you find here is a stress test aimed at verifying that the schedulers do
well under intense load.
It is a simple test that combines the latency calibration with the preemption
example in such a way to have two level of preemption nesting on an odd number
of tasks. The odd number should be relevant as it mixes up scheduling with 
messages under SMP. 

To verify what is happening you can launch either "./checkl", for the latency
output, or "./checkp" for the preemption output. You can choose also to execute
them both on different screens.

Note that under UP the tests suck more than 95% of the computing power. Change 
ticking to decrease the load. So be careful to adjust test parameters to your
machine to avoid unfair blames on the scheduler.

We tested for some hours (up to 10), both 8254 and APIC, with the followings: 
	- at least one "ping -f somewhere";
	- a "ping -f localhost";
	- a "top" on alpha screen and one on an X screen;
	- a "while "true"; do ls -lR / >list; done"
	- a "while "true"; cat /proc/interrupts; done"
	- dd if=/dev/hda2 of=/dev/hda3 bs=1000k &
