This is a simple helper task that kills any LXRT processes.
It works but must be used with some care when killing a hard real time process 
that interacts with other hard real time peers, e.g. in such a case the order
in which processes are killed can be important.

Its usage is much as the standard Linux kill, i.e.:
./killh pid.

Notice that a hard real time LXRT process is forced back to soft whenever a 
signal is sent to it. Thus the standard kill should work also, with the same
care suggested above, and maintaining the specific hardkill mode is done just 
to gather some more experience on how they work.
