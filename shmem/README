Shared Memory
=============

This directory contains an RTAI specific module that allows sharing memory
inter-intra real time tasks and Linux processes. In fact it can be an
alternative to SYSTEM V shared memory, the services are symmetricall, i.e.
the same calls can be used both in real time tasks, i.e. within the kernel,
and Linux processes.

The function calls for Linux processes are inlined in the file
"rtai_shm.h".  This approach has been preferred to a library since: is
simpler, more effective, the calls are short, simple and just a few per
process. See the related README in directory Documentation.
