****** SWITCHES EXAMPLE ******

This directory checks task switching time by repeated use of suspend/resumes
and semphore signal/waits. In case you are slicing microsecs note that the
results are related to a relativily heavily loaded task queues, i.e. 30 tasks,
both for the semaphore waiting and suspended tasks lists. Moreover they 
include full FPU support.

To run the example type:

make clean
make
./run

When it stops type:

./rem

Alternatively use your own insmod/rmmod after make.
