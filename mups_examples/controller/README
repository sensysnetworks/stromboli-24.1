This directory shows how you can use the module rtai to install interrupt
handlers that can guarantee an effective processing with a contained jitter
and high effectivness.
It is an improvment of the corresponding test case found under examples and
can be used only on MPs. It requires to install just rtai, newfifos and shmem,
no scheduler. Here you can see how to install a timer per CPU without 
disturbing Linux, using shared memory to communicate and newfifo services to
coordinate.
It can be the simplest way to build high performance controllers under MP,
as you have not to care to pend any timings to the kernel.
It implements that same periodic controller doing a lot of floating point 
calculations, distributed to all available cpus. The computer load it creates
is controlled by the macros in controller.h and you can verify the jitter, even 
without a scope, by looking at the printed messages.

To use it:
make
./run
   answer the requested data, then look at the screen
./rem
