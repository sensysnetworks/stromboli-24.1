when no-fp is on, need to return errors in the schdulers
for rt_task_init() and use_fpu(). done on up.

move lxrt/registry.h to include/registry.h

Dave's to-do list:

 - change prototype of interrupt routines
 - release script doesn't update Makefile version
 - remove old copytos
 - lots of examples depend on the parallel port, and thus do not
   work on non-i386
 - we need some arch-independent way to include asm/rtai_srq.h
 - examples/lockcpu needs work
 - rt_modprobe: add flag to only load the dependencies

LXRT:
 - doesn't even compile on ppc

bugs:


Should the mups_examples be compiled if the mups scheduler is not?


Current things that are broken:

  lxrt/rtw:
    doesn't compile

  various:
    APIC-related warnings and errors on UP kernels
