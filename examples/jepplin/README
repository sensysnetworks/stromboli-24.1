****** JEPPLIN EXAMPLE ******

This example demonstrates the use of semaphores and message queues.
It is an adaption to RTAI of what is found in the NMT-RTL distribution. It was 
developed by J. Epplin to show the working of his IPC services for NMT-RTL.
So everything is to be intended copyrighted their way, we just changed some
names and a few things here and there to make it the way we like.
Its output is to the console, so running it in a normal xterm wouldn't be very 
interesting.
To use it type:

make
./run

To remove it type:

./rem

Alternatively use your own insmod/rmmod after make.
