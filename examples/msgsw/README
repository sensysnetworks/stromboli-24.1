****** MSGSW EXAMPLE ******

This example features NTASKS real-time tasks running periodically.
On each period a server task is messaged to set/reset a bit on the parallel 
port. By choosing an appropriate timing one can produce a rectangular wave
which can be watched on an oscilloscope plugged into it.

->>>> Be carefull about the macro TICK_PERIOD its value is now set for a
      200 MHz PPro, which can be to much for a less powerfull machine.

To run the example type:

make clean
make
./run

To stop it type:

./rem

Alternatively use your own insmod/rmmod after make.
