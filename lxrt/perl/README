    Perl bindings to the lxrt system in RTAI
    ----------------------------------------

Introduction
------------

This extension provides bindings to the lxrt system in RTAI-2.4.


Installation
-------------

To install the binding (<rtai> is the place you installed RTAI).  

cd <rtai>/lxrt
tar zxvf LXRT-0.30.tar.gz
cd LXRT-0.30
perl Makefile.PL
make
make test

The test will print out some stuff.

If you are happy with this, as root install by doing:

make install


Limitations
-----------

- I have not put the bindings for the semaphore stuff in yet

- 64 bit long long items are not supported by standard perl (although they
are in versions 5.005_63).  This means you cannot do 64 bit arithmetic 
unless you have the right version of perl.  Also a value that exceeds 2 ** 32 
will cause problems.

- Only limited testing has been done.
