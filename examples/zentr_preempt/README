****** ZENTR_PREEMPT EXAMPLE ******

WARNING FROM RTAI DEVELOPPERS.
What you'll find here has been slightly modified our way. There is also the
possibility of executing in a continuous loop, just type "./loop". Note that
we often found it difficult to kill the all stuff and had to reboot, i.e. 
CTRL-ALT_DEL, to stop the loop.
END OF WARNING FROM RTAI DEVELOPPERS.

This test can be use to verify that preemption withing the scheduler is
working as expected.

The test works by starting 2 RT tasks, the highest priority one with a 
5 millisecond period and a lower priority one with an 8 millisecond period.
Both tasks spin in a busy loop which is empirically calculated to take about 
2 milliseconds (it is factored by bogomips/cpu frequency to present the 
same load on all machines).  Each task writes to a fifo before the start of
its busy loop and after.  The user process preeempt gathers the data from
the fifo and prints the results to stdout, this data is piped to a perl 
program (peconv) that gathers 25 samples before printing the results in
an easily understood bit string.

To run this example type:

make
t, this data is piped to a perl 
program (peconv) that gathers 25 samples before printing the results in
an easily understood bit string.

To run this example type:

make
./run
./run_test

You should see something like the following if the test passes:

[root@dell preempt]# ./run
