This is a fun example entirely written in C++ (or almost, see file mod.c).
It features a number of things:

	. A RTAI real time task object class Task,
	. A fifo server FifoSrv class derived from Task,
        . A template class RTFifo to manage a single fifo,
	. A template classe RTBidirectionalFifo composed with two
          RTFifo objects to implement a simple synchronous IPC scheme,
	. A module that instantiates a RTFifo object in init_module().          
	. A trivial user program that reads the output of fortune from a pipe
	  and sends it to the kernel fifo server to rt_printk the message.

Notice that you will not get C++ exception handling and global constructors 
in the kernel unless you're prepared to work hard for it - but it can be done.

The makefile also compiles example test_mem to demonstrate how lxrtlib
can be used to have C++ programs with *huge* stacks and memory heaps.
Notice that class Hrt encapsulates completely the API steps required to
enter/leave hard real time in user space. 

Have fun.
